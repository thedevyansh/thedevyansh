# Hi, I'm Devyansh.

I'm an undergraduate at National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, pursuing my major in Information Technology. As a passionate developer, I focus on driving innovative outcomes by getting involved in diverse communities with an emphasis on clean and maintainable code. My past internships and personal projects apply technologies including AWS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Databases, etc.

I like to read about almost anything, aspire to open-ended conversations and tinker with the latest technologies to find efficient ways to solve problems.
