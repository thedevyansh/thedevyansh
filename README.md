# Hi, I'm Devyansh.

I consider myself to be a passionate software engineer. (No, really.) I love building and driving impactful & innovative outcomes, all while being a sucker for clean and maintainable code. I am highly interested in fintech and open source development.

I love cinematography and reading Dark Academia. Free free to get in touch if you want to talk books and how vintage libraries & darkness fascinate you because the world is in dire need of it.
