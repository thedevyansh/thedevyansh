# Hi, I'm Devyansh Chawla.

I'm an undergraduate at National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, pursuing my majors in Information Technology. I am a passionate developer who likes to solve real-world problems by thinking along the lines of clean and maintainable code. 

I have been a Google Summer of Code 2021 student at Wikimedia Foundation and am the Open Source Lead of Google Developer Student Club at my college. Moreover, I am focused on driving innovative outcomes by getting involved in a diverse and inclusive community.
